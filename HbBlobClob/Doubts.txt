while using response.sendRedirect("./test2"); method is the same request and response object will be given to the test2 servlet?

in FirstServlet i set this :: request.setAttribute("name", "name");
in SecondServlet i get this :: request.getAttribute("name"); giving null
but when printing the hashcode of printwriter in first and second servlet both are same
that means response is given to second servlet but not request am i right?

RequestDispatcher Conclusion points ::
---------------------------------------
  *) if we forward req, res to another servlet from our servlet response will be flushed request will  be same without change

  *) if we forward req, res to an html file from there if request go to another servlet that same request obj and response obj will be given
